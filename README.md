# Gemini Note Helper

A plugin for Obsidian to help you write notes with Gemini.

## Features

This plugin provides several features to enhance your note-taking experience using the power of Google's Gemini models.

### Chat with Note
You can have a conversation with your notes. This feature opens a chat view where you can ask questions about the content of the current note. The plugin uses the note's content as context for the conversation.

To use this feature, open a note and run the "Chat with note" command from the command palette.

### Polish Note
This feature helps you improve the quality of your writing. It polishes the active note to make it more organized, clear, and well-written. It fixes grammatical errors and improves the structure of the text without adding new information.

To use this feature, run the "Polish note" command in the note you want to polish from the command palette. You will have a chance to modify the prompt before sending it to Gemini. The result will be inserted into where the cursor is at.

### Summarize Note
This feature provides a quick summary of your notes. It captures the key points and main ideas of the active note.

To use this feature, run the "Summarize note" command in the note you want to summarize from the command palette. You will have a chance to modify the prompt before sending it to Gemini. The result will be inserted into where the cursor is at.
